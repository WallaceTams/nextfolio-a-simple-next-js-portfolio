Minecraft and Valorant, completely different video-games with completely different gameplay. There are a multitude of reasons why Minecraft is less stressful and competitive than Valorant.
Firstly, These two games are completely different genres of games. Valorant is a tactical first-person shooter game. The game is played in two teams of five.The goal is to win 13 rounds. Both teams start on opposite sides of the map where one team attempts to either plant a bomb onto a site or kill all the people on the opposing team. The other team does the opposite. They have to defuse the bomb or kill all the people on the other team.
 In general, Valorant is a fast-paced shooter game where thinking is critical for winning. 
Minecraft, on the other hand, is an open-world survival game with completely different mechanics. This game mainly focuses on the playerâ€™s creativity as you can build practically anything you can imagine in the blocky world of yours. Not only does it have singleplayer survival, but it has multiplayer as well. You and your friends can hop on a world together or play on different servers. With this in mind, Minecraft is a game where nothing you do is wrong instead of a game like Valorant that has consequences with every decision you make.
These games are proven to have completely different styles in their gameplay. This not only makes them unique, but makes them fun and enjoyable for all kinds of gamers ranging from casual to competitive.
